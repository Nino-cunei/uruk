    "## Collocation\n",
    "\n",
    "We end this tutorial with a cliff hanger: collocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the study of cuneiform corpora it is useful to know which signs co-occur: on tablets and faces,\n",
    "in columns and lines, and in cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we just show how to compute collocation information with respect to tablets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to a future notebook [collocation](collocation.ipynb) that will be dedicated to the art and craft\n",
    "of collocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF ad\n",
    "Already the task of computing collocation of signs for tablets shows a typical pattern in the modus operandi of Text-Fabric. In order to compute collocation efficiently, we have to grab a significant swath of the data, and reorganise it before we can do business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bad news is**: Text-Fabric does not have the right organization for this particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The good news is**: You can put the data in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The best news is**: because of the IKEA-like organization of the data in TF, you can easily\n",
    "put your bits and pieces in a cart, walk outside, and stack it in new ways to your liking.\n",
    "Indeed, the bit that draws the data from TF and puts it into the required form, is only\n",
    "a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to collocation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we collect all pairs of signs that co-occur on a tablet\n",
    "* we compute a measure of co-occurrence: \n",
    "  * closer together is better\n",
    "  * more tablets with the same co-occurence is better\n",

    "### Collect sign-pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "We want signs with primes, variants and modifiers, but without flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first round, we collect all pairs of signs that have a co-occurrence on a tablet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two signs co-occur on a tablet.\n",
    "Both may have multiple occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is: what is a sensible measure for the the degree of co-occurrence of that pair on\n",
    "that tablet?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we ignore the faces, columns, lines and cases that the signs occur in.\n",
    "The only thing that counts is the distance between two occurrences, seen as slots.\n",
    "Every sign has a sequence number, its slot number, which tells you where the sign stands in the whole\n",
    "corpus. The distance between two slots is just the difference of those slots as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two signs on a tablet is the minumum distance you can find between an occurence\n",
    "of the one and an occurrence of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we turn distance into closeness.\n",
    "If, on a tablet of 200 signs long, there are signs with occurrences on 40 and 60,\n",
    "their distance is 20, but there closeness is 200 - 20 = 180.\n",
    "We shall make that closeness proportional to the length of the tablet (in signs): \n",
    "180 / 200 = 0.9\n",
    "\n",
    "The same signs may co-occur on other tablet. We also compute the relative closeness there.\n",
    "In the end, we add it all up.\n",
    "\n",
    "So every pair of signs gets a measure that expresses the total relative closeness of its co-occurrences\n",
    "on all tablets where they co-occur."
