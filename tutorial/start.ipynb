    "### Why Text-Fabric?\n",
    "When you search for tablet data in an ATF file, you can do so conveniently by using regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ATF transcriptions have become packed with information. Not every transcriber uses ATF in the same way, and there are a few coding errors in the sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the most obvious search expressions will leave out cases. Either you live with that, or you refine your search expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An other issue is, that when you look for something, your search expressions must reflect the shape of not\n",
    "only your target, but also everything else. There is virtually no separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your search task becomes complicated, your mind tends to get overloaded with the details of the transcription format, rather than with the quest you would like to have in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also want to be able to divide a research task into smaller chunks.\n",
    "Whereas regular expressions are a wonderful tool to look for patterns, on their own they fall short\n",
    "when your search involves nested structures, intermediate sets of patterns, special functions.\n",

    "**The good news is**: You can put the data in the right order.\n",

    "**The best news is**: because of the IKEA-like organization of the data in TF, you can easily\n",
    "put your bits and pieces in a cart, walk outside, and stack it in new ways to your liking.\n",
