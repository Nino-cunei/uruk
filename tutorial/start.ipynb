    "\n",
    "## What is Text-Fabric?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cuneiform tablets in ATF\n",
    "\n",
    "Cuneiform tablets have been transcribed in ATF files, in which the marks on a tablet are represented\n",
    "by ascii characters. The marks on a tablet have structure (they can be composed, they build cases and lines) and properties (they can be uncertain).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you search for tablet data in an ATF file, you can do so conveniently by using regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ATF transcriptions have become packed with information. Not every transcriber uses ATF in the same way, and there are a few coding errors in the sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the most obvious search expressions will leave out cases. Either you live with that, or you refine your search expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An other issue is, that when you look for something, your search expressions must reflect the shape of not\n",
    "only your target, but also everything else. There is virtually no separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text-Fabric\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-Fabric is a model for textual data with annotations that is optimized for efficient data analysis. Not only that, it also facilitates the creation of new, derived data, which can be added to the original data.\n",
    "Data combination is a feature of Text-Fabric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-Fabric is being used for the\n",
    "[Hebrew Bible](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa)\n",
    "and a large body of linguisitic annotations on top of it. The researchers of the \n",
    "[ETCBC](http://etcbc.nl) thought that a plain database is not a satisfactory text model,\n",
    "and that XML is too limited too express multiple hierarchies in a text smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why they adopted a model by\n",
    "[Doedens](http://books.google.nl/books?id=9ggOBRz1dO4C)\n",
    "that reflects more of the essential properties of text (sequence, embedding). This model is the basis of MQL, a working text-database system.\n",
    "Text-Fabric is based on the same\n",
    "[model](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/wiki/Data-model),\n",
    "and once the data is in Text-Fabric, it can be exported to MQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "See more on the effort of modeling the Hebrew Bible in Dirk's article\n",
    "[The Hebrew Bible as Data: Laboratory - Sharing - Experiences](https://doi.org/10.5334/bbi.18)\n",

    "Working with TF is a bit like buying from IKEA. You get your product in bits and pieces, and you assemble it yourself. TF decomposes any dataset into its components, nicely stacked per component, with every component uniquely labeled. You go to the store, make your selection, enter the warehouse, collect your parts, and, at home, assemble your product.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to enjoy an IKEA product, you do not need to be a craftsman, but you do need to be able to handle a screw driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the TF world, it is the same. You do not have to be a professional programmer, but you do need to be able to program little things. A first course in Python is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another parallel: in IKEA you take a package with components home, and there you assemble it. \n",
    "In TF it is likewise: you download the TF data, and then you write a little program. Inside that program you can call up the Text-Fabric tool, which act as the IKEA user manual. But your program takes control, not Text-Fabric.\n",
